# Hypergeometric_Monte_Carlo
Monte Carlo sampling from the hypergeometric distribution 

The code in this repository provides statistical insight and visualizations of monte carlo simulations 
of the hypergeometric distribution. 

The genesis of this project was the necessity to provide a customer with the true number of successes in a population using a
small sample size. Pulling samples from this population was expensive and a roughly 90% confidence interval gave from 2 up to 6 successes 
in a sample size of 6, which was not helpful.  These visualisations help provide an intuitive understanding of the true number of successes 
in a population.
