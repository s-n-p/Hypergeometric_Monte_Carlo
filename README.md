# Hypergeometric_Monte_Carlo
Monte Carlo sampling from the hypergeometric distribution 

I was asked to provide some statistical insight on a project whose population is a hypergeometric distribution.  
It is necessary to provide the customer with the true number of successes in the population but each single sample from 
the population is expensive to produce.

I produced these graphs and charts to help those working on this project gain an intuitive understanding of 
the results of the samples and understand the probabilities of the true distribution based on the samples.
